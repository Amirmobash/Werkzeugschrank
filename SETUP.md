# 🔥 Industrial Tool Cabinet

### Smart Tool Management System for Modern Factories

**Designed & Built by Amir Mobasheraghdam**

---

## 🚀 Project Launch Statement

**Industrial Tool Cabinet** is a **fully developed, production-ready smart tool management system** designed for real industrial environments.

This is **not a concept**.
This is **not a demo**.
This is a **working industrial solution**, built to solve real shopfloor problems.

---

## 🏭 What Is This System?

A **smart, always-on industrial kiosk** that controls, tracks, and documents the usage of hand tools inside a cabinet.

It combines:

* Industrial software
* Physical hardware control
* User accountability
* Visual documentation

Into **one simple workflow for operators**.

---

## ⚡ Why This Project Exists

In many factories:

* Tools disappear
* Responsibility is unclear
* Manual logs are unreliable
* Operators waste time
* Management has no transparency

**Industrial Tool Cabinet fixes this.**

---

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

✔ Employee-based tool access
✔ Article-based tool selection
✔ Physical relay-controlled unlocking
✔ Automatic video recording
✔ Full traceability (CSV logs)
✔ No menus, no exits, no misuse
✔ Designed for 24/7 operation

---

## 🖥️ Operator Experience (Zero Training)

1. Scan employee badge
2. Enter article number
3. Choose reason (if machine exists)
4. Select tool
5. Tool unlocks automatically

That’s it.

No configuration.
No confusion.
No mistakes.

## 🔐 Industrial-Grade Control

* Hardware-controlled relays (Arduino Mega)
* Safe startup (no random relay activation)
* Separate indicator light relay
* Offline-capable
* No network dependency
* No cloud required

---

## 🎥 Built-In Visual Proof

Every tool release:

* Triggers a countdown
* Unlocks the tool
* Turns on a light
* Records video automatically

This creates **visual accountability** without slowing down production.

---

## 🧱 Technology Stack

* **C# WinForms (.NET 8)**
* Arduino Mega
* 16-channel relay board + light relay
* USB webcam
* Industrial PC / Panel PC

Stable. Proven. Industrial.

---

## 🧩 Flexible by Design

The system is intentionally built to support future extensions:

* RFID tool detection
* Automatic return verification
* ERP / MES integration
* Multiple cabinets
* Centralized logging
* Tool lifetime analytics
